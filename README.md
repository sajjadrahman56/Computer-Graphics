# Computer-Graphics
 The Computer Graphics Repository is a collection of algorithms related to computer graphics. It contains code examples that cover various topics, such as drawing basic and implementing graphics algorithms.
 
## Here's a summary of the algorithms covered:

1. Bresenham's Line Algorithm: This algorithm helps draw straight lines on a computer screen in an efficient way.

2. DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm: This algorithm also helps draw lines, but it uses a different approach by using floating-point calculations.

3. Circle Drawing Algorithm: This algorithm is used to draw circles on a screen by calculating the points that make up the circle's outline.

4. Clipping Algorithms: These algorithms help determine which parts of a shape or line should be visible on the screen, especially when dealing with objects that are partially outside the viewing area.

5. Transformation Algorithms: These algorithms are used to change the position, size, or orientation of objects on the screen. They can be used for tasks like moving, rotating, scaling, or distorting graphics.
